<p>I'll feed your cat, walk your dog and water your plants while you go on holiday. I don't take on lots of jobs and offer a bespoke service and can even bake you a cake or get the shopping in for when you get home!</p>

<h2 id="about">About me</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52" src="http://jennielonglegs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/jenny-pic.jpg" alt="Jennie Smith" />
<p>My name is Jennie. I love animals, nature and the great outdoors.</p>

<p>I am an experienced pet and house sitter living in central Brighton and as I don't have my own pets I would love to give yours my undivided attention!</p>

<p>I have plenty of experience working with animals and I’m interested anything from bees to billy-goats. As well as pet-sitting I have also worked on city and rural farms and am a regular at my local community allotment project, where I spend a disproportionate amount of time staring into the murky waters of the wildlife ponds hoping to spot a newtlet or two. </p>

<p>While full of love and hugs for your pet, I understand that being away from their owners can be a disruptive time so take seriously their adherence to any routines or special requirements. I’m happy to be flexible and work according to their needs – from popping in to check on them to longer stays or taking your beloved pet for regular exercise. </p>

<p>I don’t take lots of pets on at once, so can guarantee you a personal service.</p>

<p>While you're away I can also water the plants and garden, get some basic shopping in or even bake you a cake to welcome you home.</p>

<p>I am:</p>
<ul>
	<li>reliable</li>
	<li>respectful</li>
	<li>flexible</li>
	<li>have a common-sense approach</li>
	<li>full DBS checked</li>
</ul>
